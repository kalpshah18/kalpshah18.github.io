Hi, I am Kalp.

I am pursuing a Major in Electrical Engineering, along with a Minor in Computer Science and Engineering, set to graduate in 2028.
I like to develop efficient systems in C++ and am delving into Machine Learning now. My Academic Journey includes hands on projects in Data Analysis,
Hardware(FPGA Basys3) and leadership as a Coordinator in the Technical Council of the IIT Gandhinagar.
